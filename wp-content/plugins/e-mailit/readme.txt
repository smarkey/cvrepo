> **ATTENTION / IMPORTANT**: The E-MAILiT Domain Verification System will place automatically the meta tag code snippet to the specified url source code, which was given by you, to the Website Settings > Domain.

<h4>Do I need to edit html or javascript?</h4>

There is no need to edit any line of code. The whole installation procedure of our plugin, will take place at your WordPress admin control panel. If you want a custom solution, you should create an E-MAILiT account. In that case you must combine the E-MAILiT admin control panel options with your WordPress admin control panel options.

<h4>How do I eliminate/remove the plugin from certain page(s) or post(s)?</h4>

When editing a post or page, you can check the "E-MAILiT" option in "screen options" to enable E-MAILiT remove meta box.

<h4>How do I activate / de-activate your plugin?</h4>

Please, read the guide here http://wordpress.org/plugins/e-mailit/installation

<h4>I can't remove your plugin. Are you giving us a trouble plugin?</h4>

It would be dumb and catastrophic for us, to develop a plugin which can not uninstall from the computer systems. After receiving a few support messages, on how to remove the plugin, have been revealed that the default un-installation procedure, isn't working for all, because when they installed the E-MAILiT button they had done it using the manual installation process. As a result, when they decided to un-install, they thought that by removing the plugin, it will also remove the javascript code which they had manually inserted in their websites. The result of this awkward situation is that those specific users are contacting with our support team, claiming that our plugin is a harmful malware, which leaves code behind, because they can not un-install it from their website. The only code that the plugin is going to position in a website, can be found here /wp-content/plugins/emailit directory, and there is no way for our plugin to work properly, if this folder has been deleted. We would like to inform, that our plugin is officially being accepted, after a thorough testing, from the WordPress Plugins Directory. Also, we don't write the un-uninstallation code of the plugin. This is an automated proccess through WordPress. After some threads to our support forum and a single private message via email, we wanted to put an end on this and finally to make it clear to any user, who tries to un-install with the wrong way our plugin.

<h4>How do I link the Facebook Like Button or the Tweet Button to my pages?</h4>

Facebook Like Button displays the likes about a specific url. In order to show correctly your likes you must place the button in the right place. If you haven't inserted the button in your home page, propably your likes are linked to it. If in case this is valid, by placing the button in your home page you will see the correct like counter for your site.

<h4>Facebook Share Button seems to show an incorrect number! Why?</h4>

The count result is common for share and like interactions. Please, see here https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/like-button/ There are counters for posting an article or sharing a page content. These are two seperate different interactions. But you can include the Share button next to the Like button, having more sharing options to display on your website and not feeling confused about the similar counters. You will have two different buttons together, with one counter only to display.

<h4>How do I set the integrated Follow Channels inside to my share button menu?</h4>

Create a free account and go to http://www.e-mailit.com/widget/control/add_domain

<h4>What languages do you support?</h4>

Afrikaans, Albanian, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan; Valencian, Central Khmer, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch; Flemish, English, Esperanto, Estonian, Faroese, Finnish, French, Galician,  Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, Haitian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Korean, Kurdish, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian, Luxembourgish, Malay, Maltese, Mongolian, Northern Sami, Norwegian, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai, Tswana, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, Welsh, Yiddish.

<h4>Why do I get your ads? How can I terminate them? Are you a spammer?</h4>

We are not spammers. By default, when a visitor returns to your site, after clicking to share your content via a service, they will see an advertisement, on the left of the share menu. This advertisement never shows when the share menu of the E-MAILiT button opens at first. It will never show up on your visitor's screen, if they do not click on a sharing service. Our strategy is not making you or your visitors feel frustrated, so we display advertisements in this smart way. On the other hand, you have the option to automatically show/hide the Ad Display on the widget's share menu. The advertisement is there for anyone interested to see, or you can simply hide it! It is that easy. The only thing you need to do is to create a free account and customize your settings.

<h4>Does your share button appears last in my pages and causes extra loading time to my site?</h4>
<ul>
<li>Well-engineered and optimized code will not slow or block your website pages from loading.</li>
<li>We use caching via major global CDNs. A content delivery network (CDN) can give an equally fast web experience across the globe and is a collection of web servers distributed across multiple locations to deliver content more efficiently to users.</li>
<li>Asynchronous ensure a fast page launch by loading your E-MAILiT button script at the end, without long wait periods, keeping your visitors engaged with your content.</li>
<li>Google Page Speed Insight Compliant / Optimized.</li>
<li>Use very light weight script which do not effect your site's loading speed.</li>
